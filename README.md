## Overview

__Cultivons!__ is a software in the form of an internal site aiming at helping the management of a BAD (Sustainable Autonomous Base).

A BAD is a place where one or more people can (over)live a disaster (natural, plague, war, economic collapse ... put here the reason that pleases you or scares you the most), for a more or less long period of time, without needing the outside: supermarkets, hospitals, and other services present in a modern society.

This definition is a little broad, in fact a BAD will often materialize by a place in the countryside where one will try to be as autonomous as possible on the most important aspects of survival:

* food (vegetable garden, orchard, animals... everything that is culture and breeding);
* electricity;
* water (including potabilization);
* heating;
* first aid;
* storage of recipes, guides and other documentation...

With __cultivons!__, you can manage 
- your crops, your garden and the associated tasks (semi, harvest) as well as garden plan.
- the weather,
- the stocks,
- your documents,
- your budget (Bank Account).
